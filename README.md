# EduConnect-Bridging-the-Learning-Gap-with-AI

Millions of students with disabilities face challenges in traditional education due to the lack of accessible tools and adaptive learning environments. The AI-Powered Inclusive Learning Hub is an Android-based intelligent educational platform that uses Artificial Intelligence to provide a personalized, accessible, and engaging learning experience for all students â€” including those with visual, hearing, cognitive, and learning disabilities.

-> Problem Statement

Students with disabilities often struggle in conventional classrooms due to limited accessibility options.

Visually impaired students lack Braille or text-to-speech support.

Hearing-impaired learners miss lectures without sign language translation.

Dyslexic students face reading difficulties due to complex texts.

ADHD learners find it difficult to stay engaged in static learning environments.

Existing e-learning systems fail to address these individual needs.
Our solution bridges this gap by creating a personalized AI-based education hub that adapts to each learnerâ€™s unique requirements.

-> Methodology

The system is designed as an AI Tutor Application consisting of the following modules:

User Profile (B) â€“ Collects basic details like name, age, and learning preferences.

Disability Selection (C) â€“ Allows users to specify their disability type (visual, hearing, cognitive, dyslexia, etc.).

Adaptive Interface (D) â€“ Customizes UI elements such as text size, voice output, and visual aids.

Learning Content (E) â€“ Provides personalized educational material aligned with the learnerâ€™s preferences and abilities.

Progress Tracking (F) â€“ Tracks performance, delivers AI-driven feedback, and dynamically adjusts content difficulty.

-> Key Features / Outcomes
